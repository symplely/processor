Processor
=====

An simply process control wrapper API for [symfony/process](https://github.com/symfony/process) to execute commands in sub-processes.

It's an alternative to pcntl-extension, when not installed. This is part of our [uppes/eventloop](https://github.com/uppes/eventloop) package for asynchronous PHP programming.

The library is to provide an easy to use API to control/manage sub processes for windows OS, and other systems, without any additional software installed.
